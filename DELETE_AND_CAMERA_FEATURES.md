## üìê Feature 2: Camera Control Sliders

### Overview
Precise camera positioning with three interactive sliders for complete control over your viewing angle!

### Location
In the **right-side control panel** when viewing a model, under "Camera Controls" section.

### Three Control Sliders

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Distance Slider**
- **Range:** 2 - 30 units
- **Step:** 0.5
- **Default:** 10
- **What it does:** 
  - Controls how far the camera is from the model
  - Closer = More detail, zoomed in
  - Farther = Full view, zoomed out

**Usage:**
```
Distance: 5.0  = Close-up view
Distance: 15.0 = Standard view
Distance: 25.0 = Wide view
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Height Slider**
- **Range:** -10 to +20 units
- **Step:** 0.5
- **Default:** 5
- **What it does:**
  - Controls camera vertical position
  - Negative = Looking up from below
  - Zero = Eye level
  - Positive = Looking down from above

**Usage:**
```
Height: -5.0  = Ground/bottom view
Height: 0.0   = Horizontal/eye level
Height: 10.0  = Top/overhead view
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Rotation Slider**
- **Range:** 0¬∞ - 360¬∞
- **Step:** 5¬∞
- **Default:** 0¬∞
- **What it does:**
  - Rotates camera around the model
  - Like walking in a circle around object
  - 0¬∞ = Front, 90¬∞ = Side, 180¬∞ = Back, 270¬∞ = Other side

**Usage:**
```
Rotation: 0¬∞    = Front view
Rotation: 90¬∞   = Right side
Rotation: 180¬∞  = Back view
Rotation: 270¬∞  = Left side
```

### Visual Design

**Panel Styling:**
```css
Background: rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.2)  /* Soft indigo */
Border: 1px solid rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.4)  /* Indigo border */
Padding: 12px
Border Radius: 8px
```

**Header:**
- üìê Icon + "Camera Position" text
- Color: #a3b8ff (light indigo)
- Font: 13px, bold

**Sliders:**
- Same gradient styling as form sliders
- Real-time value display
- Smooth animations
- Instant camera updates

### How It Works

**Mathematical Formula:**
```javascript
// Convert polar coordinates to Cartesian
const angle = rotation * (Math.PI / 180);  // Degrees to radians
const x = Math.cos(angle) * distance;      // X position
const z = Math.sin(angle) * distance;      // Z position
const y = height;                          // Y position

// Set camera position
camera.position.set(x, y, z);
```

**Why This Works:**
- Uses polar coordinates (distance + angle)
- Converts to 3D Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)
- Always looks at center (0, 0, 0)
- Smooth interpolation between positions

### Interactive Behavior

‚úÖ **Real-Time Updates**
- Camera moves instantly as you drag slider
- Smooth interpolation for natural movement
- No lag or delay

‚úÖ **Preserved Target**
- Camera always looks at model center
- Model stays in focus
- Orbiting around origin point

‚úÖ **Works With Other Controls**
- Combines with orbit controls
- Preset buttons still work
- Reset button available

### Use Cases

#### Product Photography Angles
```
Distance: 8
Height: 3
Rotation: 45¬∞
‚Üí Classic 3/4 view
```

#### Top-Down View
```
Distance: 10
Height: 15
Rotation: 0¬∞
‚Üí Overhead/plan view
```

#### Dramatic Low Angle
```
Distance: 12
Height: -8
Rotation: 135¬∞
‚Üí Hero shot from below
```

#### Close Detail Shot
```
Distance: 3
Height: 5
Rotation: 90¬∞
‚Üí Close-up side detail
```

### Tips & Tricks

**For Best Results:**

1. **Start with Distance**
   - Adjust distance first to frame your model
   - Then fine-tune height and rotation

2. **Use Rotation for 360¬∞ Views**
   - Set distance and height
   - Animate rotation 0¬∞ ‚Üí 360¬∞ for turntable effect

3. **Height for Drama**
   - Low height (negative) = Heroic, powerful
   - High height (positive) = Analytical, technical

4. **Combine with Presets**
   - Use preset buttons for quick angles
   - Then use sliders to fine-tune

5. **Reset When Lost**
   - Click "Reset Camera" button
   - Returns to default position
   - Resets all slider values

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Future)

*Planned features:*
- [ ] Arrow keys for rotation
- [ ] +/- keys for distance
- [ ] PgUp/PgDn for height
- [ ] Number keys for preset angles

## üìä Technical Details

### Delete Functionality

**State Management:**
```javascript
const { removeScene } = useScene();

const handleDeleteScene = (sceneId, e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();  // Don't select when deleting
  if (confirm('Are you sure?')) {
    removeScene(sceneId);
  }
};
```

**Context Update:**
```javascript
const removeScene = (sceneId) => {
  setScenes(prev => prev.filter(s => s.id !== sceneId));
  setCurrentScene(prev => 
    prev?.id === sceneId ? null : prev
  );
};
```

### Camera Control

**State Variables:**
```javascript
const [cameraDistance, setCameraDistance] = useState(10);
const [cameraHeight, setCameraHeight] = useState(5);
const [cameraRotation, setCameraRotation] = useState(0);
```

**Position Calculation:**
```javascript
const angle = cameraRotation * Math.PI / 180;
const x = Math.cos(angle) * cameraDistance;
const z = Math.sin(angle) * cameraDistance;
controlsRef.current.setPosition(x, cameraHeight, z, true);
```

**OrbitControls Integration:**
```javascript
// Uses three-stdlib OrbitControls
// setPosition(x, y, z, smooth)
// smooth=true enables animation
```
